# Resume Writer Excel

As a part of the Georgia Tech Engineering For Social Innovation group, I created a resume writing app for the IOS and Android operating systems which allows special education students in Georgia Techâ€™s Excel program to create a resume and submit it to a career counselor. The application is written in Swift, Objective C, with the resumes being rendered using HTML and CSS. This project was a major stepping stone for me because it gave my my first exposure with holding meetings and interacting with a client, but most importantly it granted me my first experiences with AGILE software development practices. The first version ResumeWriter was relatively simple. It had a black and white UI with a basic table that showed every entry in the user's resume, a couple of entries for a settings screen, and users could only render one type of pdf: black and white. Through meeting with the students and understanding their needs I was able to transform the table into a vibrant " resumeWallet", devise a more neutral theme that was easier on the eyes, and most importantly offer four styles of resumes. Starting in the Fall of 2018, resumeWriter(Excel) will begin being implemented into the Excel program's curriculum in a career preparation course, in which I will still participate in teaching the students and faculty as well as getting more feedback on what I could improve with the app.
